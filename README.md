What it does
Deployed on Polygon, Sepolia, and Avalanche
Create a Post: Every post is treated as a signed transaction with your wallet, incurring a cost of 0.75 cents to the platform. To facilitate this process, a dedicated smart contract will be implemented. This contract will handle both the payment transaction and the storage of the post in the Database/UI.

Remarks/Comments: Each remark or comment on a post functions as a signed transaction with your wallet, incurring a cost of 0.25 cents. Similar to the post creation process, a smart contract will be essential for managing this transaction. The contract will not only process the payment for the comment but will also send the Payment/Donation to the wallet address of the user who created the original post.

Conceptual Framework: The core concept driving the Paid Speech platform is the establishment of a space independent from traditional advertising. The platform is designed to empower users and their followers by facilitating paid interactions. Users are encouraged to connect and engage in discussions spanning a diverse array of subjects, including News, Life, Entertainment, Finance, Sports, Crypto, Technology, Business, Government, and more. The unique aspect lies in the ability to financially back your statements â€“ literally putting your money where your mouth is.

Addressing Issues: Paid Speech aims to address challenges such as bots, spam, and irrelevant content by introducing a cost barrier. This financial model ensures that users have a vested interest in the quality and relevance of their contributions. In this way, the platform becomes a more authentic space for meaningful interactions. Even humorous content, like memes, comes with a price tag, discouraging frivolous or malicious activities. Haters, too, will find themselves in a position where they need to financially commit to expressing their negativity.

In summary, Paid Speech not only revolutionizes the monetization of online interactions but also fosters a more genuine and engaged community by introducing financial accountability to the digital discourse.
